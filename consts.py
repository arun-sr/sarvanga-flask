The doctor at the centre understood our requirement well & suggested us the treatment to be taken. The full body Bundi herbal oil massage which I took was extremely good. Pramod the staff did the overall massage quite well. Feeling light & relaxed. My family members with me on this Kerala vacation also took some treatment and are satisfied.
