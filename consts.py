        "description": "Podikizhi (also known as Podi Kizhi or Choorna Swedam) is a traditional Ayurvedic powder poultice therapy. Medicinal herbal powders—such as Kottamchukkadi, Rasnadi, Dashanga, and others—are combined, tied into muslin boluses (‘kizhi’), warmed (often dipped in medicated oils like Dhanwantharam or Ksheerabala thailam), and rhythmically applied to the body. The treatments typically begin with an oil massage (Abhyanga), and last between 45–60 minutes per session, over a course of 7–14 days. Therapeutic heat, oil, and herbal properties work together to stimulate circulation, induce sweating, reduce inflammation, and relieve muscle and joint stiffness. Post-therapy care includes warm baths and light diet.",

This treatment is usually preceded or followed by Abhyanga (full-body oil massage) to relax muscles and prepare the body. The oil pot is held about 10 cm above the forehead, often moved in rhythmic patterns to enhance sensory effect. Liquids used vary depending on dosha imbalance and include sesame, coconut, sunflower oils, ghee, buttermilk, milk, or herbal decoctions. Oils are often enriched with herbs such as Ashwagandha, Brahmi, Bhringaraj, Gotu kola, Shatavari, and Skullcap.
